# godist

Some simple scripts to distribute tools written in Go, used by
[modd](https://github.com/cortesi/modd) and
[devd](https://github.com/cortesi/devd).

Note that these scripts depend on the structure of modd and devd, and although
they can easily be generalized, they're not really meant to be portable to
other projects. That said, I'd accept pull requests to make godist useful to
others.

The following external tools are required:
